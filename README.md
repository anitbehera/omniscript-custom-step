1. Override the Step LWC.(Go to setup of OS > Element Type to LWC Mapping > Element Type = "Step", LWC = "customStep") - Refer screenshot 1
2. Hide step buttons.(Make all the step button width to 0) - Refer screenshot 2.
3. Provide button labels.( Leave empty whereever not required, e.g- for the first step leave empty for "prev" and for last step leave empty for "next" label) - Refer Screenshot 3
4. Activate your OS to see the changes.
5. I've added CANCEL button in the html, you may remove it if not required for your use case.
